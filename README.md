## üîç Overview

FileWatcher is a lightweight, cross-platform utility designed to monitor file system events and trigger webhook-based automation workflows. Available in both Go and Python implementations, it provides a simple yet powerful solution for initiating automated processes in response to file creation, modification, deletion, or movement.

The Go version offers enhanced performance and cross-platform compatibility, while the Python version provides excellent flexibility and ease of use.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of file system events
- **Configurable event filtering** (created, modified, deleted, moved)
- **Pattern matching** for specific file extensions
- **Webhook integration** with custom authentication
- **Cross-platform support** via Go implementation
- **Non-blocking webhook calls** for improved performance
- **Comprehensive logging**
- **Easy deployment** as a system service

## üì• Installation

### Go Version

#### Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher

#### Building from Source

Build for your current platform:

```bash
go build -o watcher
```

Or use the included build script for multi-platform builds:

```bash
go run tools/build.go
```

You can also use the Makefile for easier building:

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Build only for current platform using build script
make build-current
```

This creates binaries for various platforms in the `dist` directory.

#### Build Script Options

```
-output string
    Output directory for binaries (default "dist")
-version string
    Version number for the build (default "1.0.0")
-current
    Build only for the current platform
```

Example with custom options:

```bash
go run build.go -output releases -version 1.2.0
```

### Python Version

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required packages:
  - `watchdog`: Core file system monitoring
  - `requests`: HTTP client for webhook integration

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

FileWatcher uses a JSON configuration file (`config.json` by default) with the following structure:

```json
{
    "FileWatcher": {
        "directories": ["/path/to/watch", "/another/path"],
        "event_types": ["created", "modified", "deleted", "moved"],
        "file_extension_pattern": "*.csv",
        "post_url": "https://your-webhook-url.com/endpoint",
        "authentication_header": "YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN"
    }
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
|-----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `directories` | Array of directory paths to monitor (includes subdirectories) | Yes | - |
| `event_types` | Array of event types to monitor (`created`, `modified`, `deleted`, `moved`) | Yes | - |
| `file_extension_pattern` | File pattern to match (e.g., `*.csv`, `*.log`) | No | `*.*` |
| `post_url` | Webhook URL to receive event notifications | Yes | - |
| `authentication_header` | Authentication token for webhook security | Yes | - |

## üöÄ Usage

### Go Version

Run with default configuration:

```bash
./watcher
```

Specify a custom configuration file:

```bash
./watcher -config /path/to/custom-config.json
```

### Python Version

Run with default configuration:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Specify a custom configuration file:

```bash
python3 main.py -c /path/to/custom-config.json
```

## üîÑ Running as a Service

### Linux (systemd)

1. Create a systemd service file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/watcher.service
```

2. Add the following content (adjust paths as needed):

#### For Go Version

```ini
[Unit]
Description=File Watcher Service (Go)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yourusername
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/watcher
ExecStart=/path/to/watcher/watcher
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### For Python Version

```ini
[Unit]
Description=File Watcher Service (Python)
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=yourusername
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/watcher
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/watcher/main.py
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable watcher.service
sudo systemctl start watcher.service
```

### Windows

For Windows environments, you can use NSSM (Non-Sucking Service Manager):

1. Download NSSM from [https://nssm.cc/](https://nssm.cc/)
2. Install the service:

#### For Go Version

```
nssm install FileWatcher-Go
nssm set FileWatcher-Go Application C:\path\to\watcher.exe
nssm set FileWatcher-Go AppDirectory C:\path\to\watcher
```

#### For Python Version

```
nssm install FileWatcher-Python
nssm set FileWatcher-Python Application C:\path\to\python.exe
nssm set FileWatcher-Python AppParameters C:\path\to\watcher\main.py
nssm set FileWatcher-Python AppDirectory C:\path\to\watcher
```

3. Start the service:

```
nssm start FileWatcher-Go
# or
nssm start FileWatcher-Python
```

## üîó Webhook Integration

When a matching file event occurs, FileWatcher sends a webhook POST request with the following payload:

```json
{
  "filepath": "/full/path/to/directory",
  "filename": "file.csv",
  "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

The webhook includes the authentication header specified in your configuration.

Both implementations use:
- Non-blocking webhook calls (Go uses goroutines, Python uses threads)
- Debouncing to prevent duplicate events
- Unique event IDs for tracking

For integration with automation platforms, use `$.filepath` and `$.filename` to reference the file information in your automation workflows.

## üìè Scalability

FileWatcher is designed to efficiently monitor several hundred directories on a single instance. For larger deployments:

- Deploy multiple instances with different directory subsets
- Consider batching file events for high-volume scenarios
- Ensure your webhook endpoint can handle the expected request volume

**Performance Considerations:**
- The Go version offers significantly better performance for high-volume monitoring
- Webhook calls are non-blocking to prevent monitoring interruptions
- Consider both the parallelism and queuing capabilities of your automation system

**Limitations:**
- Events that occur while the service is stopped will not be detected upon restart
- Very high file change rates may require custom throttling or batching
